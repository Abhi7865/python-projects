In this program, we ask the user to choose an operation. Options 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 are valid. If any other input is given, Invalid Input is displayed and the loop continues until a valid option is selected.

Two numbers are taken and an if...elif...else branching is used to execute a particular section. User-defined functions add(), sub(), multi(), div() & mod() evaluate respective operations and display the output.
